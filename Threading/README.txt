To run program in Ubuntu:

1) Make sure to have g++ installed in your top level directory. Open the terminal and type "sudo apt install g++"
2) Navigate to your Desktop folder using ls and cd and create a directory to store the program in using mkdir "programName"
3) Go to github and view the raw file of the program. Right click and select save as. Store the main.cpp file in your new directory
4) Type g++ -o program main.cpp to compile
