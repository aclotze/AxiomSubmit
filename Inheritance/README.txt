To run the files on Ubuntu:

1) To begin, make sure you have installed g++ in your top level directory. To do this, open a terminal and type "sudo apt install g++" 
2) Next, navigate to your desktop folder using the ls and cd commands and create a directory to store the files in using the mkdir command
3) Download the files you need from the github repo by viewing the raw file and selecting "save as". Save them in the directory you created for this project.
4) Once you have all of the files from github, you are ready to compile
5) type g++ -o program Fruit.cpp main.cpp Fruit.hpp
6) This will compile the files listed and output an exectuable named "program"
7) Execute "program" by typing ./program in the console
